## Lesson Plans by Grade Level

### Middle School (Grades 6-8)

#### **Lesson 1: Introduction to Stage Positions**
**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Preset:** Empty Stage
**Learning Objectives:**
- Students will identify and describe the 9 basic stage positions
- Students will explain why stage terminology uses the actor's perspective
- Students will demonstrate blocking using proper terminology

**Materials Needed:**
- Theater-Stage platform (one device per student or pair)
- Stage position handout (provided below)

**Lesson Sequence:**

1. **Hook (5 min):** Show a famous scene from a play/movie. Ask: "How do directors tell actors where to stand?"

2. **Direct Instruction (10 min):**
   - Load the "Empty Stage" preset
   - Enable stage markers (Toggle Markers button)
   - Explain the 9 positions:
     - **USL** = Upstage Left (back left from actor's view)
     - **USC** = Upstage Center
     - **USR** = Upstage Right
     - **SL** = Stage Left
     - **C** = Center
     - **SR** = Stage Right
     - **DSL** = Downstage Left
     - **DSC** = Downstage Center
     - **DSR** = Downstage Right
   - Discuss why "upstage" is toward the back (historical: raked stages)

3. **Guided Practice (15 min):**
   - Students place 3 actors in positions you call out
   - Example: "Place Actor 1 at DSC, Actor 2 at USR, Actor 3 at SL"
   - Use different camera angles to see the positions
   - Students practice calling out positions to partners

4. **Independent Practice (10 min):**
   - Students create a simple scene with 4 actors
   - Write down the position of each actor
   - Partner exchange: load each other's scenes and identify positions

5. **Closure (5 min):**
   - Quick quiz: Show a scene, students write down positions
   - Exit ticket: "Why is it important to use consistent terminology?"

**Assessment:**
- Formative: Observation during guided practice
- Summative: Position identification worksheet (80% accuracy)

**Differentiation:**

     - **Variety:** Avoid static scenes

3. **Guided Practice (15 min):**
   - Load "Family Dinner" preset
   - Read a short family dinner scene (provided)
   - As a class, block the scene:
     - Who sits where? Why?
     - Who stands? When?
     - How do positions show power dynamics?

4. **Independent Practice (10 min):**
   - Students work in pairs
   - Each pair blocks a different moment:
     - Family argument
     - Celebration
     - Secret revealed
   - Save their scene and share screen

5. **Gallery Walk & Feedback (5 min):**
   - Pairs present their blocking
   - Class discusses: What relationships do you see?

## Tips for Remote Learning

### Best Practices for Online Classes

**1. Screen Sharing:**
- Use collaboration mode so all students work together
- Rotate who controls the scene each class
- Use video conferencing screen share for presentations

**2. Breakout Rooms:**
- Put students in pairs for design work
- Each pair gets their own "room" session
- Bring back together to share

**3. Asynchronous Options:**
- Students design scenes independently
- Save and submit files for teacher review
- Record screen capture videos explaining choices

**4. Engagement Strategies:**
- Use polling: "Which lighting preset works best?"
- Gallery walks: View each other's saved scenes
- Peer feedback via discussion boards

### Technical Troubleshooting

**If platform is slow:**
- Reduce number of props in scene
- Use simpler presets
- Close other browser tabs

**If collaboration isn't working:**
- Check firewall settings
- Use single-user mode and share screenshots
- Save files and exchange via learning management system

**For tablet users:**
- View-only mode works well
- Can participate in discussions
- Pair with desktop user for hands-on work
