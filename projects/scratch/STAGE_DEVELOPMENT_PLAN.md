# 3D Stage Development Plan - Multi-Phase Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Interactivity (Week 1-2)
### Goal: Establish basic interactive stage with essential elements

**Stage Elements**

- [ ] Simple UI overlay for controls

## Phase 2: Enhanced Stage Mechanics (Week 3-4)
### Goal: Add dynamic stage elements and improved controls

**Stage Elements**

- [ ] Rotating center stage section
- [ ] Trap doors with animation
- [ ] Orchestra pit (lowered front section)

**Set Pieces**
- [ ] Modular wall system (flat panels)
- [ ] Basic stairs unit
- [ ] Simple backdrop system (2D images)
- [ ] Balcony piece

**Interactive Elements**
- [ ] Curtain open/close animation
- [ ] Prop placement mode with grid snapping

- [ ] Lighting console UI (sliders, presets)
- [ ] Cue system for lighting changes
- [ ] Real-time shadow mapping improvements

## Phase 4: Set Design & Scene Management (Week 7-8)
### Goal: Complex set pieces and scene transition system

**Set Pieces**
- [ ] Multi-level platforms system
- [ ] Curved stair units
- [ ] Archways and doorways
- [ ] Tree/forest pieces
- [ ] Interior walls with windows

**Scene Management**
- [ ] Scene preset system (save complete setups)
- [ ] Smooth transition animations
- [ ] Set piece storage system (off-stage)
- [ ] Quick-change mechanisms

**Technical Features**
- [ ] Set piece library/catalog
- [ ] Drag-and-drop set designer
- [ ] Collision detection for set pieces

## Phase 5: Actor Support Systems (Week 9-10)
### Goal: Systems specifically for AI actor integration

**Actor Features**
- [ ] Spawn point system
- [ ] Movement paths/tracks
- [ ] Interaction zones (where actors can interact)
- [ ] Height-adjustable marks (for different actor sizes)

**Performance Tools**
- [ ] Recording system for movements
- [ ] Playback of recorded performances
- [ ] Multiple actor choreography tools
- [ ] Timing/cue system for entrances

**Integration Features**
- [ ] Actor attachment points (for props)
- [ ] Costume change areas
- [ ] Actor-specific lighting (pin spots)

## Phase 6: Advanced Interactivity & Polish (Week 11-12)
### Goal: Professional features and user experience

**Interactive Elements**
- [ ] Full lighting board interface
- [ ] Sound zone system (3D audio areas)
- [ ] Audience simulation (filled seats)
- [ ] Special effects triggers

**Advanced Set Features**
- [ ] Projection mapping on surfaces
- [ ] Video backdrop support
- [ ] Moving set pieces on tracks
- [ ] Fly system (hanging set pieces)

**Polish & Optimization**
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Mobile-responsive controls
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Help system/tutorials
- [ ] Export/import full show files

## Phase 7: Show Production Tools (Week 13-14)
### Goal: Complete theatrical production system

**Production Features**
- [ ] Show timeline/script integration
- [ ] Cue sheets (lighting, sound, set)
- [ ] Stage manager view with annotations
- [ ] Tech rehearsal mode

**Collaboration Tools**
- [ ] Multi-user support
- [ ] Change tracking
- [ ] Version control for shows
- [ ] Director's notes system

**Documentation**
- [ ] Automatic technical drawings
- [ ] Lighting plots
- [ ] Set diagrams
- [ ] Prop lists

## Implementation Priority Matrix

### Critical Path (Must Have)
1. Basic prop system
2. Lighting presets
3. Camera controls enhancement
4. Curtain animation
5. Save/load functionality

### High Priority (Should Have)
1. Moving platforms
2. Fog effects
3. Scene presets
4. Actor spawn points
5. Lighting console UI

### Nice to Have (Could Have)
1. Projection mapping
2. Audience simulation
3. Video backdrops
4. Multi-user support
5. Technical drawings

## Technical Dependencies
- Three.js extensions for effects
- Physics engine for prop interactions
- State management system
- File I/O for save/load
- UI framework for controls

## Success Metrics
- Stage can support 10+ actors simultaneously
- Scene changes under 5 seconds
- 60 FPS performance maintained
